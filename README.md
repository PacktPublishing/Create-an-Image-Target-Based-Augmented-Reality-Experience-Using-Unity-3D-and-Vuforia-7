## About the Video Course
In this course, you’ll learn how to create a great augmented reality (AR) app in less than two hours. You’ll go from complete beginner to feeling comfortable creating AR experiences. The course begins by introducing you to both the Unity website and Vuforia's augmented reality software development kit. After installation, we’ll guide you through the basic configuration and import the assets provided to complete your first AR experience. You’ll learn how to import and animate 3D characters, add music and build the app out to an Android or IOS device to see the AR magic come together. 
Assets Included: 
•	Two character models
•	Dancing animations
•	An audio track
•	The image target file and the unity package
•	A couple of bonus wallpapers that the author created
This is a crash course introduction on how Vuforia works and how to use their image target asset to create your first app. As this is a bitesize course, it doesn't cover all aspects in Vuforia's array of assets but it does give you a solid foundation that you can build on to create mini augmented reality experiences for marketing prototypes or 3D model spawning. It also covers the basic use of extended tracking.
